# TIDs Detection

## Description
This project is divided in different scripts for multiple purposes with one common objetive: identify and analize TIDs (Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances) properties and related data such as local time and month ocurrence by different statistical procedures.

Python was chosen for this project for the sake of "simplicity" to develop the mathematical routines using Numpy and Scipy, software provided by the Python community for scientific computing.

## Data adquisition
The data was adquired from GNSS receivers located over Mexico, which are also part of the National Seismological Service and Transboundary, Land and Atmosphere Long-Term Observational and Collaborative Network (SSN-TLALOCNet). 


## Software and package versions
The Python version in which the project was made is 3.11.3.

Numpy, Scipy, lmfit and Matplotlib are the packages that were used in the elaboration of this project; to install the specific versions execute either of the following commands in a CMD/Powershell terminal in Windows or a GNOME terminal in Linux:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

In the case you use Python with Anaconda Software, use the following command:

```conda install --file requirements.txt```
